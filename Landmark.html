                <p>Saipan is home to wonderful landmarks around the island, there are so much more than what this page
                    shows. The adventuring never ends.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The images to the left are American Memorial Park which serves as the island's park to do various
                    activites like play sports, have a picnic, or for going on walks. And the second image is called
                    suicide cliff, this was the site where the Japanese had to commit suicide to avoid being captured by
                    the Americans in their conquest to take over the island from Japanese forces.

                <p>
                    Now on our right side we can see another cliff with the sea at the bottom. This is called Banzai
                    cliff, where this was another location where the Japanese commited suicide and there are also
                    gravestones near the site to honor their deaths.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The second image is called Bird Island. This is an island where lots of birds like to flock around
                    and fly over during most of the year, hence the name Bird Island.

                <p>To our left we can see the highest point of all of Saipan with a Jesus statue on the top. This whole site looks over the all of the island, its really an amazing view.

                    <br>
                    The next image is called Grotto, it is basically where the ocean is connected and so lots of people snorkel and swim to enjoy the underwater scenary filled with lots of fish and coral
